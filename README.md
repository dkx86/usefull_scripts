# USEFULL SCRIPTS

Various useful scripts that I wrote to make my life easier. 

1. **make_backup.sh** - shell script to make backup of the direcory using rsync.

2. **make_backup_simple.sh** - shell script to make backup of the direcory using rsync. 
Same as (1), but you must supply source and destintation paths into the script body, not in the argument. 
See `SOURCE_DIR_PATH` and `BACKUP_ROOTDIR_PATH` variables.
It usefull if you always backup same direcory to the same destination.
